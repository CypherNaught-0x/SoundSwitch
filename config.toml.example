# Fuzzy matching algorithm to use when fuzzy-match is enabled.
# Options:
#   - "skim" (default): Fast fuzzy matching optimized for interactive search
#   - "levenshtein": String similarity based on Levenshtein distance, better for handling
#                    device name variations like "Headset (2)" vs "Headset (3)"
# Note: This setting is ignored when fuzzy-match is false.
fuzzy-match-algorithm = "levenshtein"

# Fuzzy match threshold for the Levenshtein algorithm (0.0 to 1.0).
# - 1.0 = exact match required
# - 0.8 (default) = strict, requires 80% similarity (good for minor variations)
# - 0.5 = moderate, allows device names with ~50% difference
# - 0.3 = permissive, allows device names with ~70% difference
# Lower values are more permissive. Adjust based on your device name variations.
# Note: Only used when fuzzy-match-algorithm is "levenshtein".

# Define your hotkey mappings here.
# 'keys' uses a format like "Modifier+Modifier+Key" (e.g., "Ctrl+Shift+F1", "Alt+1").
# Supported modifiers: Ctrl, Alt, Shift, Win (Super/Meta).
# See the 'global_hotkey' crate documentation for specific key names.
# 'device-name' is the friendly name of the audio output device as shown in Windows Sound settings.
# 'input-device-name' (optional) is the friendly name of the audio input device to switch to automatically.
